# Hand gesture recognition
Gesture Recognition Using Image Data
This Jupyter Notebook performs basic image processing and gesture recognition setup using a small dataset of grayscale gesture images. It involves loading and preprocessing gesture image data for further machine learning tasks such as classification.

# Features
• Image loading using OpenCV.

• Image resizing and grayscale conversion.

• Label assignment for gesture classification.

• Basic data preparation for model training.

# Libraries Used
• NumPy

• Pandas

• Matplotlib

• OpenCV (cv2)

• scikit-learn (for data splitting)
